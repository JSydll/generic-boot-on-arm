# Generic (UEFI-based) verified boot and update on ARM

This repository aims to provide a reference implementation for generalizing some of the concepts known
from the server and desktop world to embedded devices.

It stands on the shoulders of giants - namely Linaro and Siemens - already pushing this approach
since a few year. Yet, it tries to further simplify the overall setup and only include the basic
verified boot and A/B update scheme here.

Currently, only an integration for `qemuarm64` is available. A port on a representative hardware board may follow.

## Wait, but why?

- cross-validation from widespread use in the server & desktop world
- rather sophisticated specification
- reduce development & maintenance effort
- cover some gaps, like missing (default) signature for FIT config itself (see [u-boot docs](https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/usage/fit/signature.html#signed-configurations))

Also pushed by:
- Embedded Base Boot Requirements [EBBR](https://arm-software.github.io/ebbr/)
- Linaro & ARM partnership on SystemReady

## Approaches

- **Linaro**'s [Trusted Substrate](https://trusted-substrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/software_components.html) 
  -> TF-A, OP-TEE, u-boot [EFI provider] + systemd-boot [EFI payload, switching BL] + UKI on ESP (vfat) (+ update unclear)
- **Siemens** 
  -> TF-A, OP-TEE, u-boot [EFI provider] + efibootguard [EFI payload, switching BL] + UKI on ESP (vfat) + swupdate

> **meta-generic-boot**: TF-A, OP-TEE, u-boot [EFI provider, switching BL] + UKIs w/ profiles (no ESP, squashfs or raw partitions possible) 

**Improvement goals**:
- less components to reduce complexity
- full artifact signing
- support for partitioning and no dependency on ESP
- robust filesystems support
- sophisticated boot counting possible (in comparision to `systemd-boot`'s file-rename-based approach)

### Considerations

**General preconditions for UEFI on ARM**

- ARM TrustZone for extended firmware support
- eFuses and/or eMMC with Replay Protected Memory Blocks (RPMB) for storing the keyring

**Splitting OS and bootloader updates**

Established approaches on embedded Linux devices often use a common path for both updating the Linux side 
of the system as well as the bootloader (see RAUC's capabilities on doing that, for example).
In contrast to this, the TF-A architecture and UEFI specification separate the two by defining
[capsule updates](https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/develop/uefi/uefi.html#enabling-uefi-capsule-update-feature)
for updating the firmware (at least the extended firmware scope or _FIP_ [Firmware Interface Package]).
This would then also include the bootloader.
An advantage of this is, again, that implementations must follow a clear specification, while some aspects like
the requirement for a FAT-based EFI System Partition are potential downsides - especially in the embedded context.

**Alternatives to using u-boot as switching bootloader**

_Reasoning according to Siemens:_

- Low trust in its (UEFI-related) implementation
- Missing support for (secure) storage of the switching flag (i.e. `BootOrder` and `BootNext`)
- Early exit from watchdog

- Trusted Firmware for Cortex-A ([docs for QEMU](https://github.com/ARM-software/arm-trusted-firmware/blob/master/docs/plat/qemu.rst), [blog](https://lnxblog.github.io/2020/08/20/qemu-arm-tf.html))
- [`meta-arm`](https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-arm) for `TF-A`, `EDK2`, ...
- UKIs with multiple profiles ([ukify docs](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/ukify.html#Examples))
- `u-boot` as EFI provider ([docs](https://docs.u-boot.org/en/latest/develop/uefi/uefi.html))

- QEMU ARM virt machine ([doc](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/arm/virt.html))

## Challenges and limitations

### Secret handling

Common approaches: efuses, OP-TEE w/ RPMB eMMC (yet, this is still accessible from userspace), burned into binary

Issues:
- No guaranteed protection against access from kernel / userspace
- In QEMU: missing emulation support

> **meta-generic-boot**: Limited due to secrets built-in to u-boot binary, requiring firmware update for key rotation.

- [Patchset for QEMU](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/qemu-devel/list/?series=470527) by Jan Kriska for RPMB support

### Runtime, authenticated variables

Current status: no SetVariableRT in u-boot (barebox maybe?)

**Readings**:
- Overview by Ilias at Linux Plumbers 2023 ([Session](https://lpc.events/event/17/contributions/1653/), [PDF](https://lpc.events/event/17/contributions/1653/attachments/1338/2682/Plumbers%20-%20EFI%20setvariable%20problems%20and%20solutions.pdf))

> **meta-generic-boot**: Limited by a workaround loading variables from an ESP in separate disk and manually persisting it by copying over changes only written in RAM (also comes with a different u-boot config). Also no further means to protect against rollback are implemented yet.

### Gapless watchdog configuration

Current status: Potential gap between ExitBootServices & Kernel watchdog activation

U-Boot has support for serving the hardware watchdog until ExitBootServices() (according to the UEFI spec).

**Readings**:
- Discussions about the u-boot implementation in the [trusted-firmware.org mailinglist](https://lists.trustedfirmware.org/archives/list/tf-a@lists.trustedfirmware.org/thread/MLS2QZ7LLTEMOUIU5OUF4YMQ67UHAADV/)

## Loose ends

- Fine-tune watchdog configuration to avoid a gap?
- Build testenv Docker image including changes in `QemuDriver`
- Automatically provide secrets for update bundle signing
- Upstream patches in `meta-arm` and `labgrid`
- Upstream extensions for `uki.bbclass`
- Take over patchset on QEMU for RPMB eMMC emulation and remove workaround
- Implement **capsule updates** for bootloader updates

## General observations

- Many of the involved open source projects lack beginner documentation
- Implementations by Linaro and Siemens have a lot more features than the presented approach (which makes it hard to understand at times)
- Lots of building blocks already in upstream layers - though quality & maintenance needs to be monitored

## Recent advances in alternative approaches

- Barebox will (soon) support direct FIT image verification - further reducing the attack surface for altered content in the OS images
