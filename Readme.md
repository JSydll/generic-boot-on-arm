# Generic, UEFI-based boot for embedded ARM machines

This repository aims to collect the bits and pieces - as well as current limitations - for a
boot and update flow running on UEFI, on ARM.

It stands on the shoulders of giants - namely Linaro and Siemens - already pushing this approach
since a few year. Yet, it tries to further simplify the overall setup and only include the basic
verified boot and A/B update scheme here.
